Subject-Concerns regarding my root cause analysis


  Dear Pankaj,
                 Please accept my deepest apologies.
                 It is with deep regret that we missed the deadline for Project  which was supposed to be delivered to your desk this morning.
                 We were working hard as a team but there were certain issues with the codes.
                 As a result, before we could place the completed project plans on your desk, we made the decision to wait until the codes were rechecked.
                 
                 I would be thankful to u if u could provide an extenstion to the deadline


Regards
