Subject- (Concerns regarding my root cause analysis)


  Dear Pankaj,

                 It is with deep regret that we missed the deadline for Project  which was supposed to be delivered to your desk this morning.
                 Due to a misunderstanding in scheduling, the incorrect materials were delivered to our office from our main source provider. 
                 As a result, before we could place the completed project plans on your desk, we made the decision to wait until the materials arrived. These project plans will be on your desk by 6pm tonight.

Please accept my deepest apologies and understand that this will not happen again. Thank you so much for your kind attention to the above matter.

Regards
Azam Khan
